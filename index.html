    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="summary" id="box">I am Computer Science student at Hunter College, currently in my last year before graduation and I am someone who is passionate about learning and exploring everything I can. I am highly interested in persuing a carrier as a Software Engineer and I am eager to start learning and figuring out if that carrier is the best for me. <br><br>
    I also have some experience with Data Science which is also something I am interested on. I have worked through interships and reaseach projects with groups like the NSF and NOAA CREST. With experience like that I can confidently say that I am good with numbers and not afraid of learning new stuff, even if is really diferent from my area of expertice.</P>
